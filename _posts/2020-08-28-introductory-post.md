Hiya!
I am a senior English major from Houston, TX.  My favorite film is "The Secret Garden" (1993).  It's my favorite because the story is beautiful and it captures the essence of the English moors which I am in love with, thanks to my favorite novel "Wuthering Heights" by Emily BrontÃ«.  I love jazz, indie and classic rock, and classical music.  I am a member of the Lord of the Rings, Jane Austen, Poldark, BBC Period Dramas fandoms.  I sew my own dresses, and I play piano.  My creative mind keeps my busy at all times, and I greatly enjoy the opportunity to interact with others who love sharing and/or expressing their creativity.
I am taking ENGL 460 because I am interested in learning how to adapt my writing skills to a digital format.  I would love to work in publishing which I think involves a great deal of digital writing.
